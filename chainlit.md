# AI Agent with Chainlit: Weather Info App

This repository contains the code for an AI agent built as part of a YouTube video tutorial. The app allows users to interact with a smart assistant that fetches real-time weather information for any city, using a sleek chat interface powered by Chainlit. Designed for beginners and AI enthusiasts, this project demonstrates how to create a practical AI agent with free tools, perfect for exploring automation!

The app is built using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** for the agent’s core logic, **WeatherAPI** for real-time weather data, and **Chainlit** for the interactive frontend. We manage dependencies with **UV**, a fast Python package manager, and deploy the app on **Hugging Face Spaces** for free hosting. Check out the video tutorial for a step-by-step guide on setting up Python, coding the agent, creating a custom weather tool, and launching the app. The repo includes `weatheragent.py`, `main.py`, and `pyproject.toml` to get you started.
